# Google Takeout Photo Reorganizer

Like many of us, I wanted a copy of my Google Photo's in the cloud for my personal archive cause... you never know. ;-) I had already tried the Google Photo API route only to be sadly disappointed that the pictures I mananged to download we missing vital metadata like the geo-location tags, and others... Google Takeout was the other option... in which you download everything in a huge series of ZIP files, containing an absolute mess of all of your photos.

With this simple tool you can process this complete series of ZIP files into a folder a much more logical directory structure, making exporting photos from the cloud a breeze.
